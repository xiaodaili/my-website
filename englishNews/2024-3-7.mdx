"The food sector in China has been highly homogenized, and an increasingly niche and detailed segment has continued to emerge.Thanks to the high popularity of hotpot in China, the use of cilantro has become more frequent in different scenarios," said Zhu Danpeng, an analyst tracking the food and beverages industry.

"Cilantro-flavored food is considered a short-lived product, not a gimmick merely to attract public attention.There are many cilantro enthusiasts in China, and such products provide personalized choices for those groups of consumers," Zhu said.

China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd, the largest privately owned juice maker in China, said it plans to launch 100 percent cilantro juice in late March or April, and the product will be available online as a limited edition.

By then, when the first batch of new cilantro is ripe, juicing will better preserve and reflect the original flavor of cilantro, the juice maker said.

Last year, Zhengzhou, Henan province-based instant noodle maker Baixiang Food Group introduced an instant noodles product in cilantro flavor, as the company found that topics related to cilantro were played back more than 4 billion times on short-video platform Douyin.

On Chinese social media platforms, the topic of whether one likes to eat cilantro or not has been frequently discussed for long, with polarizing opinions.

Creating a new topic or dish related to cilantro has become a natural way to connect with more young Chinese consumers, industry insiders said.
